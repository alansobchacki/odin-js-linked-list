About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum. It is the seventh project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [7/12].

These were the project requirements:

Build the following functions in your linked list class / factory:

- [x] `append(value)` adds a new node containing value to the end of the list.
- [x] `prepend(value)` adds a new node containing value to the start of the list.
- [x] `size` returns the total number of nodes in the list.
- [x] `head` returns the first node in the list.
