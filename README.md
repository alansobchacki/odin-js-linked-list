Project: Linked List
=============

A basic linked list algorithm. You can build a linked list and add/remove nodes at will.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-js-linked-list/) 

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum. It is the seventh project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [7/12].

These were the project requirements:

Build the following functions in your linked list class / factory:

- [x] `append(value)` adds a new node containing the value to the end of the list.
- [x] `prepend(value)` adds a new node containing value to the start of the list.
- [x] `size()` returns the total number of nodes in the list.
- [x] `head()` returns the first node in the list.
- [x] `tail()` returns the last node in the list
- [x] `at(index)` returns the node at the given index
- [x] `pop()` removes the last element from the list
- [x] `contains(value)` returns true if the passed-in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
- [x] `find(value)` returns the index of the node containing the value, or null if not found.
- [x] `toString()` represents your LinkedList objects as strings. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null

Optional tasks:

- [x] `insertAt(value, index)` that inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
- [x] `removeAt(index)` that removes the node at the given index.

What I Learned
-----
Well, I already knew about linked lists because I did this project with Ruby first. Still, it's been a while, so it was fun to refresh my knowledge with linked lists and use JavaScript instead.
